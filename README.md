## ‚ú® Overview

**QuizCraft AI** is an intelligent web application designed to effortlessly generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from any given text. Leveraging the power of Google's state-of-the-art Gemini Large Language Model, it's a perfect tool for students, educators, and content creators looking to quickly create quizzes and test comprehension.

Say goodbye to manual question creation ‚Äì simply paste your content, and let QuizCraft AI do the rest!

## üöÄ Features

* **AI-Powered MCQ Generation:** Generates relevant and diverse MCQs from arbitrary text content.
* **Google Gemini Integration:** Utilizes the advanced `gemini-1.5-flash` model for high-quality question generation.
* **Structured Output:** Presents questions with four distinct options and a clear answer key in a user-friendly tabular format.
* **Interactive Answers:** Answers are hidden by default and can be revealed with a single click, perfect for self-testing.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** Built with Streamlit, featuring a sleek "Brighter Deep Ocean" blueish theme for an intuitive user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback for API issues, input problems, or generation failures.

## üí° How It Works

QuizCraft AI combines several cutting-edge technologies to deliver its functionality:

1.  **Text Preprocessing:** The input content is intelligently split into smaller chunks to efficiently interact with the LLM's token limits.
2.  **Prompt Engineering:** A carefully crafted prompt guides the Gemini model to generate MCQs in a precise, structured format.
3.  **Generative AI (Gemini):** The core AI engine that understands the input text and generates new, relevant questions and options.
4.  **Information Extraction (NLP):** Regular expressions are used to parse the LLM's raw text output, extracting questions, options, and answers into a structured format.
5.  **API Integration (LangChain):** The application communicates with the Google Gemini API using the LangChain framework, simplifying the interaction with the LLM.
6.  **Web Interface (Streamlit):** Streamlit provides the interactive frontend, allowing users to easily input text and view generated quizzes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python**: Core programming language.
* **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**: The Large Language Model (LLM) for generative capabilities.
* **LangChain**: Framework for interacting with LLMs and building AI applications.
* **Streamlit**: Python framework for building and deploying interactive web applications.
* **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and tabular display of MCQs.
* **Requests**: For handling HTTP requests (e.g., Lottie animations).
* **python-dotenv**: For secure management of API keys in local development.
* **streamlit-lottie**: For integrating dynamic Lottie animations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation

To run QuizCraft AI on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME`)*

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Obtain a Google Gemini API Key:**
    * Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to generate your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

5.  **Set your API Key securely:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory (the same folder as `app.py`).
    * Add your API key to this file in the following format:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your key. **Do not share this file or commit it to GitHub!**)*

6.  **Optional: Download Lottie Animation (for local reliability):**
    * Go to [LottieFiles.com](https://lottiefiles.com/), search for an animation (e.g., "brain," "AI"), download its "Lottie JSON," and save it as `ai_brain_animation.json` in your project root. This ensures the animation loads even if the public URL changes.

7.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open the app at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìà Future Improvements

* **More Input Options:** Allow uploading PDF/DOCX files or fetching content from URLs.
* **Customizable MCQ Count:** Let users specify the exact number of MCQs they want.
* **Quiz Mode:** Implement an interactive quiz where users can select answers and get immediate feedback.
* **Download Options:** Enable downloading MCQs in various formats (e.g., PDF, JSON, text).
* **Difficulty Levels:** Allow users to specify the desired difficulty of questions.
* **User Feedback Loop:** Implement a system to collect user feedback on question quality to potentially fine-tune the model or prompt.
