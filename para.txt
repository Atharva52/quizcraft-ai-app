Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. The process typically involves three stages: training, validation, and testing. In the training phase, the algorithm is exposed to a large dataset and learns patterns. During validation, the model is tested on a separate dataset to fine-tune its parameters. Finally, testing involves evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure its generalization ability.
